Interactive Partner Aging
=========================

This module creates new AR and AP views.

The default OpenERP Aged Partner balance report is a static PDF that is based
on the difference between credits and debits, not based on documents such as
Invoices and Payments. It also does not consider unapplied payments. This
version is interactive and more complete.

A detailed description of this module can be found at
